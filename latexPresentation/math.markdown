#LaTeX: \begin{Math Equations}

##Many ways to skin a cat
With LaTeX, there is more than one way to get things done.  In the case of equations, we can enter into math mode a number of ways (the following are only the more major ways).
- $$ is called inline
- \[...\] is called display

As seen above, we can enter the equation "editor" whenever we like with a couple of keystrokes - much easier than point-and-click!
