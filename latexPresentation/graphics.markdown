#LaTeX: \begin{Graphics}

##Using packages, including graphics
(**NOTE:**)If you're only using a web-based LaTeX engine, then your luck is beginning to run out here.  You will need it actually installed on your local PC for the examples from here on out if you want these examples to work.

To include graphics in your document, you need to a "package."  In LaTeX, that package is called **graphicx** and we use the command \usepackage to bring it's functionality into our document.  You'll also see in the code below, we're using the "figure" environment.  By using this environment, LaTeX will automatically number our figures for us!  Final note, to get the code to work, you will need a file called "dog.png" in the same directory as your .tex document.
