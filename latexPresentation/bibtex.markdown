#LaTeX: \begin{References}

##Using BibTeX
Creating your bibliography adds a degree of complexity to your life, but it shouldn't be too bad.  
[Download this .zip file](/files/latex/BibExample.zip) and extract the contents into a directory.  
"cd" into that directory from your terminal and follow these commands.  
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1889756.js?file=cmdline.bash"></script>  
This code needs you to have a main.bib file containing your references in a BibTeX format, and your main.tex file referencing that bib file.
