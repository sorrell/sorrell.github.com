#LaTeX: \begin{Setup}

##Mac
Yes, it's true, I use an Apple product, and thus the Mac gets first place on this page.  To get going with LaTeX, you need to download [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/obtaining.html) (get "Latest TeXShop").  By installing this package, you will have everything you need to get going with LaTeX.  

##Windows
You're going to be looking for [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/2.9/setup).  I've heard some stuff about an alternative recently, which gives you a "preview window" (WYSIWYM- What You See Is What You Mean).  It's called [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org/resources/downloads/29) - like I said though, MiKTeX is tried and trued. 

##Linux
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're more technical than us average schmoes... so just use your package manager to install pdfTeX, XeTeX or what have you! :)

##Web
There are online TeX compilers, so you don't even have to install it to get going!  Unfortunately, it's Flash-based, but [check out this nice compiler](http://www.sciencesoft.at/latex/flatex.gsp?lang=en)!
