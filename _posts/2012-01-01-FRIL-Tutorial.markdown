#FRIL Tutorial
Last quarter I took a class at UC which involved my first taste of logic programming.  The language we used was called FRIL and learning how to use that language after coming from an object-oriented/imperative background was a rough road.  That's because the documentation isn't that great, and there's virtually no community support.  So here's my contribution:  [A FRIL Tutorial](/files/Fril.pdf).

This tutorial covers BIPS, recursion, predicate usage, debugging, and more.  I hope this helps someone.
