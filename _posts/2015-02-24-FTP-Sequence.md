A while ago I started on a project that required a connection to an FTPS site from SSIS.  Because this functionality isn't natively baked into SSIS, I started looking around for libraries that would help augment this task.  

At the time, though, I didn't know the in's and out's of FTP, or for that matter, FTPS.  I began reading about Implicit, Explicit, Passive, Active... and I couldn't find a good concise diagram that captured all of these variations.  So I created one!  Your choice of PDF, PNG, or GraphML if you want to utilize my favorite graph editor, yEd.
