#String Copy (yes, in the key of C)
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a bit of a [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) fan (even though his advice has now stopped blooming and is only fermenting like a sound, aged wine).  So, as an aging CS student, I harken back every-so-often to his advice to his [Advice for CS College Students] (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html).
