title: Classic C + String Copy

#String Copy (yes, in the key of C)
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a bit of a [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) fan (though his advice has now stopped blooming).  So, as an aging CS student, I harken back every-so-often to his [Advice for CS College Students](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html).  One of the nuggets of advice he gives is to learn C.  

(A brief aside:  Joel also says that 'C is becoming increasingly rare' - this may have been true in 2005, but [not now](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2011/04/04/changes-programming-languages/))

Within his C-advice, he writes 
>...if you can't explain why while (\*s++ = \*t++); copies a string, or if that isn't the most natural thing in the world to you, well, >you're programming based on superstition...
